\begin{abstract}
This note is related to Simple Classifier project (\url{https://github.com/TomaszGolan/simpleClassifiers}) which was an exercise to understand two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) . Two classes of 2D points are considered within the project: {\it separable} (below or above $f(x) = x)$) and {\it inseparable} (inside or outside circle). The purpose of this note is to explain technical details of both algorithms and demonstrate how they work on simple examples. Please note, I am not an expert in the field and the note is rather how I understand the problem.
