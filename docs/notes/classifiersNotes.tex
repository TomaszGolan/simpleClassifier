\begin{abstract}
This note is related to Simple Classifier project (\url{https://github.com/TomaszGolan/simpleClassifiers}) which was an exercise to understand two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) . Two classes of 2D points are considered within the project: separable (below or above $f(x) = x)$) and inseparable (inside or outside circle). The purpose of this note is to explain technical details of both algorithms and demonstrate how they work on a simple example.
