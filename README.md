# simpleClassifier
Simple project to learn more about classifiers

Two sets of 2D points are considered:

1) below and above f(x) = x (separable)

2) inside and outside circle (inseparable)

A shift may be applied to make sets overlapped or be separate them more.

runKNN run a loop for different samples sizes and number of nearest neighbours (for both cases)

gnuplot/ contains some useful gnuplot scripts to plot everything (./gnuplot/plotKNN.sh plots all KNN results)

linear SVM implemented, kernel trick coming soon
